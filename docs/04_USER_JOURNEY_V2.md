## Executive Summary

This document maps the complete user journeys for Omnify AI Marketing Brain's **validated target customers**: mid-market DTC/hybrid brands in Beauty, Supplements, and Wellness sectors with $50M-$100M annual revenue.

**Three Decision Makers:**
1. **Sarah Martinez (CMO)** - Primary Economic Buyer (Decision Authority: 10/10)
2. **Jason Li (VP Growth)** - Secondary Buyer/Champion (Decision Authority: 9/10)
3. **Emily Chen (Director Performance Marketing)** - Influencer (Decision Authority: 7/10)

**Key Journey Insight**: All three personas experience the same core pain (attribution chaos, no predictions, reactive optimization) but require different microcopy and emphasis in the product experience.

---

## Validated Persona Profiles

### Persona 1: Sarah Martinez - CMO (Primary Economic Buyer)

**Profile**:
- **Title**: Chief Marketing Officer
- **Company**: $285M Beauty Subscription brand (Skincare/Cosmetics DTC + Hybrid)
- **Team**: 50 marketing FTE (20 in core team, 30 in operations/support)
- **Monthly Ad Spend**: $1.2M across Meta (45%), Google (30%), TikTok (20%), other (5%)
- **Current Tools**: HubSpot (CRM), Shopify (Commerce), TripleWhale (Attribution), Meta/Google/TikTok Ads Managers, Klaviyo (Email)
- **Reporting Structure**: Reports to CEO and Board, presents monthly marketing performance

**Critical Pain Points** (Ranked by Urgency):
1. **Attribution Failure (10/10 severity)**: Opens 6 conflicting dashboards every morning. Meta says ROAS 3.2, Google says 1.1, TripleWhale says something else. CEO asks "Why did CAC jump?" and there's no clean answer.
2. **Board Reporting Hell (9/10 severity)**: Spends 4+ hours weekly preparing board reports. Data doesn't match between platforms. Constantly explaining discrepancies instead of strategy.
3. **Reactive Optimization (8/10 severity)**: Finds out creative fatigued AFTER performance dropped. Lost $50K+ last quarter because no advance warning.
4. **No Strategic Visibility (8/10 severity)**: Can't answer "Should we spend more or less?" with confidence. Budget decisions feel like guesswork.

**Goals**:
- Report clearly to CEO and Board with one source of truth
- Make confident budget allocation decisions backed by data
- Predict issues 7-14 days before they impact revenue
- Reduce wasted ad spend by 15-20% ($180K-$240K annually)
- Get promoted to SVP Marketing

**Job-to-be-Done**: "Here's the truth - not what Meta thinks. Here's what will break if you don't act. Here's where to move budget tomorrow. One screen, CEO-ready."

**Buying Behavior**:
- Decision Authority: **10/10** (Controls martech budget, approves all purchases)
- Procurement Process: Can approve $499-$1,499/month SaaS without IT/Legal (under $2K/month threshold)
- Decision Timeline: 2-4 weeks (fast for mid-market)
- Key Objection: "How is this different from TripleWhale or Northbeam?"

### Persona 2: Jason Li - VP Growth (Secondary Buyer/Champion)

**Profile**:
- **Title**: VP Growth
- **Company**: $220M Cosmetics DTC/Hybrid brand
- **Team**: 35 marketing FTE (growth, creative, analytics)
- **Monthly Ad Spend**: $950K across Meta, TikTok, Google
- **Current Tools**: Salesforce (CRM), Shopify, Triple Whale, Northbeam (considering), Meta/Google/TikTok
- **Reporting Structure**: Reports to CMO, owns CAC/LTV/ROAS metrics

**Critical Pain Points**:
1. **Dashboard Fatigue (10/10 severity)**: Refreshes Meta Ads Manager every 15 minutes. Three monitors. Can't sleep when performance fluctuates without reason.
2. **Creative Fatigue Blindness (9/10 severity)**: Creatives die suddenly. Team scrambles to replace. No advance warning = wasted spend.
3. **LTV Drift Anxiety (8/10 severity)**: Cohort LTV dropping but can't predict which new customers will churn. Acquisition strategy feels reactive.
4. **Confidence Gap (7/10 severity)**: Needs to know "Creative C12 will fatigue in 3 days" with a confidence score, not "maybe it's declining."

**Goals**:
- Get 7-14 day advance visibility on creative fatigue
- Know exactly which budget moves to make tomorrow
- See confidence scores on everything (data nerd)
- Reduce CAC by 10% while maintaining LTV
- Get promoted to SVP Growth

**Job-to-be-Done**: "Creative C12 will fatigue in 3 days (confidence: 82%). TikTok cohort LTV dropped 8% (trend: declining). Shift $12K from TikTok → Meta tomorrow. Give me the numbers, give me confidence, let me execute."

**Buying Behavior**:
- Decision Authority: **9/10** (Principal martech decision-maker, rarely overruled by CMO)
- Procurement Process: Recommends to CMO, CMO approves
- Decision Timeline: 1-3 weeks (fastest persona)
- Key Objection: "How accurate are the predictions? Show me the model performance."

### Persona 3: Emily Chen - Director Performance Marketing (Influencer)

**Profile**:
- **Title**: Director Performance Marketing
- **Company**: $140M Hybrid brand (Supplements)
- **Team**: 20 marketing FTE (paid media, creative, analytics)
- **Monthly Ad Spend**: $580K across Meta, Google, TikTok
- **Current Tools**: HubSpot, Shopify, Meta/Google/TikTok Ads Managers, Supermetrics (reporting)
- **Reporting Structure**: Reports to VP Marketing, manages day-to-day campaign execution

**Critical Pain Points**:
1. **Execution Chaos (10/10 severity)**: Lives in Ads Manager. Needs to know which creatives to pause NOW, where to move budget TODAY, which campaigns are dying.
2. **No Actionable Insights (9/10 severity)**: Dashboards show data but not actions. Spends hours analyzing, needs "Pause C12 now. Move 10% from TikTok to Meta. Increase Google Brand 6%."
3. **Attribution Confusion (8/10 severity)**: Different platforms show different numbers. Can't prove which campaigns drive actual revenue.
4. **Creative Refresh Scramble (7/10 severity)**: Creative fatigue happens suddenly. Team always in reactive mode.

**Goals**:
- Get clear, executable actions (not just data)
- Know which creatives to pause, which to scale, where to move budget
- Stop firefighting, start proactive optimization
- Prove value to VP/CMO with clear ROI improvements
- Get promoted to VP Performance Marketing

**Job-to-be-Done**: "🔴 PAUSE C12 NOW. 🔴 Move 10% TikTok→Meta TODAY. 🟡 Watch LTV drift. Don't make me think - tell me what to do."

**Buying Behavior**:
- Decision Authority: **7/10** (Influences decision, exposed to attribution gaps daily, will champion)
- Procurement Process: Recommends to VP, VP recommends to CMO
- Decision Timeline: 2-4 weeks (needs VP/CMO buy-in)
- Key Objection: "Will this actually reduce my daily workload or add more tools to manage?"

## Subsector-Specific Context

### Beauty & Skincare (Rank #1 GTM Target)

**Why This Subsector First:**
- Highest pain concentration: acute post-iOS14 attribution loss
- Highest CAC inflation: 20% YoY average
- Fastest creative turnover: 2× other verticals (7-14 day creative lifespan)
- Highest SKU churn: new product launches every month
- Extreme paid-social dependence: 70%+ of ad spend on Meta/TikTok

**Example Brands**:
- $65M-$285M subscription beauty boxes
- $80M-$150M DTC skincare brands (serums, cleansers, routines)
- $120M-$200M cosmetics (makeup, lip care)

**Unique Pain Points**:
- Visual creative fatigue is brutal (video ads burn out in 10-14 days)
- Influencer marketing attribution is a mess
- Seasonal product launches create budget chaos
- Customer acquisition cost vs LTV balance is critical (high LTV but high CAC)

---

### Supplements & Nutraceuticals (Rank #2)

**Why This Subsector:**
- Cross-platform attribution confusion (health claims complicate tracking)
- High LTV/CAC drift (subscription churn is volatile)
- Rampant media waste: 12%+ average wasted spend
- Compliance complexity (FDA, FTC guidelines)
- Growing TikTok volatility (algorithm changes hurt performance)

**Example Brands**:
- $70M-$180M vitamin/supplement subscriptions
- $90M-$150M protein/fitness supplements
- $110M-$200M wellness brands (probiotics, adaptogens)

**Unique Pain Points**:
- Health claims restrict creative freedom (compliance bottleneck)
- Subscription churn is unpredictable
- LTV calculation is complex (multiple purchase cycles)
- Platform policy changes impact ad delivery overnight

> Source: 29. Unified 80-20 Pain Summary; 30. Validated ICP Summary

### Health & Wellness (Rank #3)

**Why This Subsector:**
- High churn/LTV drift
- Omnichannel fragmentation (DTC + retail + Amazon)
- Growing TikTok/Instagram dependence
- Persistent margin challenges
- High LTV sensitivity due to subscription models

**Example Brands**:
- $85M-$220M fitness equipment/apparel
- $95M-$175M meditation/wellness apps
- $120M-$250M health food/beverage brands

**Unique Pain Points**:
- Omnichannel attribution is nearly impossible
- Retail partnerships complicate ROI calculations
- Customer lifetime varies wildly by segment
- Seasonal demand swings create budget volatility

```

### Stage 1: Awareness (Week 0)

**Touchpoints**:
- LinkedIn Sponsored Post: "Mid-Market CMOs Waste $37B Annually. We Fix That."
- Industry Article: "Why Your Attribution is Lying to You (And How AI Fixes It)" 
- Peer Referral: CMO at similar beauty brand shares success story
- Conference: Booth at NRF Retail Big Show

**User Thoughts (Sarah's Internal Monologue)**:
- "This sounds EXACTLY like my problem"
- "Finally someone understands $50M-$350M companies - not just enterprise"
- "Predictive intelligence 7-14 days ahead? That would have saved me $50K last quarter"
- "One dashboard instead of six? Yes please"

**Key Messages**:
- **Headline**: "The growth brain you've been missing"
- **Subheadline**: "Predict creative fatigue 7-14 days before it happens. Omnify learns what your CRM can't."
- **Social Proof**: "Beauty brands reduce wasted spend 15-20% in first 90 days"
- **Pricing Hook**: "Northbeam quality at 1/3 the price ($499 vs $3,500/month)"

**Call-to-Action**: "See 3-Minute Demo" (not "Book a Call" - lowers friction)

### Stage 2: Consideration (Week 1-2)

**Touchpoints**:
1. Landing page exploration (2 minutes)
2. 3-minute demo video (self-serve)
3. Personalized demo call booking
4. Live demo (30 minutes)
5. Case study review (Beauty brand example)

"You're a CMO at a $150M beauty brand. You open six dashboards 
every morning. Meta says your ROAS is 3.2. Google says 1.1. 
TripleWhale says 2.4. Which one is right?"

[SCREEN: Show 6 conflicting dashboards, numbers highlighted]

"Your CEO asks: 'Why did our CAC jump 15% last month?' You 
spend an hour preparing a slide deck to explain the discrepancy. 
This is not strategy. This is survival."

### Stage 3: Decision (Week 2-3)

**Touchpoints**:
1. Pricing page review
2. ROI calculator (self-serve)
3. Competitor comparison sheet
4. Reference call with existing Beauty brand customer
5. Internal stakeholder discussion (Sarah + CFO + CEO)

**Key Decision Factors**:

**✓ Factors Driving "Yes":**
- Price ($499-$1,499/month vs $3,500+ for Northbeam)
- Fast integration (48 hours vs 6 months for enterprise tools)
- Predictive capability (7-14 day advance visibility)
- All-in-one (attribution + prediction + recommendation)
- Mid-market focus (not enterprise overkill)

**✗ Common Objections & Responses:**

| Objection | Sarah's Concern | Omnify Response |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| "How is this different from TripleWhale?" | "TripleWhale shows me data but doesn't predict or recommend" | "TripleWhale = attribution only. Omnify = attribution + 7-14 day predictions + Top 3 actions. Predictive vs reactive." |
| "How accurate are predictions?" | "What if the AI is wrong?" | "ORACLE achieves 75%+ AUC on 7-day fatigue predictions (industry benchmark). Models improve over time with your data." |
| "Will this replace my current tools?" | "Do I have to rip out HubSpot?" | "No. Omnify is an intelligence layer on TOP of HubSpot, Shopify, Meta. We don't replace - we unify and predict." |
| "What if we need more features?" | "Is this too simple for us?" | "MVP focuses on 3+1 modules (MEMORY/ORACLE/CURIOSITY/FACE). EYES, VOICE, REFLEXES coming in Phase 2. Start with prediction, expand over time." |

**Internal Discussion (Sarah + CFO + CEO)**:

Sarah: "I want to trial Omnify. $499-$1,499 per month, saves us 15-20% wasted spend."

CFO: "What's the commitment? Can we cancel if it doesn't work?"

Sarah: "Month-to-month. No long-term contract. If it doesn't save us $50K+ in first quarter, we cancel."

CEO: "Will this finally give me a clear answer when I ask 'How's marketing performing?'"

Sarah: "Yes. One dashboard. Three questions answered. You'll see MER, ROAS, risk level. I'll stop spending 4 hours preparing board slides."

CEO: "Approved. Let's trial for 90 days."

> And it's telling me EXACTLY what to do. Shift $800/day from TikTok to Meta. Pause Creative C12. Expected impact is right there.

Sarah's Slack message to CEO:
```
Just logged into Omnify. THIS is what I've been trying to build 
manually for 2 years.

One screen:
✓ Unified ROAS (2.65 blended)
✓ Creative C12 dying (82% fatigue risk)
✓ TikTok bleeding (ROAS down 32%)
✓ Top 3 moves with expected impact ($3.7K)

This is CEO-ready. Can we discuss at tomorrow's 1:1?
```

CEO's Response:
```

**Jason's Reaction**:

> "Okay, THIS is what I needed. Confidence scores. Model performance. AUC 0.79 on fatigue predictions. CVR trend data. Frequency saturation.
> 
> This isn't just 'Creative C12 might be bad' - this is 'Creative C12 has 82% probability of fatiguing within 7 days based on CVR declining 37% and frequency hitting 3.8.'
> 
> I can actually trust this data."

• LTV drift stable (no change)
        ↓
Check CURIOSITY Actions:
• Action 1: Pause Creative C15 (NEW alert)
• Action 2: Continue shifting TikTok → Meta
• Action 3: Test new TikTok creative format
        ↓
Decision:
✓ Accept Action 1 (Pause C15)
✓ Accept Action 2 (Continue budget shift)
✗ Reject Action 3 (Creative team not ready)
        ↓
9:15 AM - Open Meta Ads Manager
        ↓

### Jason Becomes a Champion (Month 2)

**Internal Slack Message to Marketing Team**:

```
@channel Just wanted to share some Omnify results after 60 days:

Before Omnify:
• Spent 10+ hrs/week analyzing dashboards
• Reactive creative refresh (after performance dropped)
• Budget moves were guesswork
• CAC: $52, LTV: $240, LTV/CAC: 4.6x

After Omnify:
• Spend 2 hrs/week (Omnify does the analysis)
• Proactive creative refresh (7-14 days advance notice)
• Budget moves backed by predictions + confidence scores
• CAC: $47 (-10%), LTV: $245 (+2%), LTV/CAC: 5.2x

We've saved ~$75K in wasted spend in 60 days. Omnify cost: $799/mo.

ROI: 9,400% 🚀

If you're not using this yet, you're flying blind.
```

**Jason Refers Two Other VP Growth Leaders**:

Jason sends demo link to:
1. VP Growth at $180M supplements brand (converts)
2. VP Marketing at $150M wellness brand (converts)

**Referral Program**: Jason gets $500 credit for each referral (2× $500 = $1,000 credit = free month)

> 
> We've saved $180K in wasted spend in 90 days. Omnify costs $799/month. ROI is 22,500%.
>
