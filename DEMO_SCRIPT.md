# Omnify Brain MVP - 3 Minute Demo Script

**Host**: "Welcome to the Omnify AI Marketing Brain. Today, I'm going to show you how we turn raw marketing data into profitable decisions in under 3 minutes."

## 0:00 - The "AHA" Moment (The Dashboard)
*Action: Open Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (Default: CMO Persona)*

"This is the FACE Dashboard. Unlike traditional analytics that just show you *what happened*, Omnify tells you *what to do*."

"Right now, we are looking at the **CMO View**. Notice the language: 'Attribution Truth', 'Strategic Risk', 'Executive Decisions'. It's high-level, board-ready intelligence."

## 0:45 - Module 1: MEMORY (The Truth)
*Action: Point to the first card (MEMORY)*

"First, the **MEMORY** module. This isn't just pixel data. We're calculating a unified **Blended ROAS** of **2.80** and, crucially, an **LTV Factor**."

"See this? We're not just tracking the first click. We're projecting the lifetime value of customers acquired today. Meta might say ROAS is 3.5, but Memory tells us the *real* contribution to enterprise value."

## 1:15 - Module 2: ORACLE (The Prediction)
*Action: Point to the second card (ORACLE)*

"Next, the **ORACLE**. This is our prediction engine. It looks 7 to 14 days into the future."

"Look at this alert: **Creative Fatigue**. The Oracle has detected that our top TikTok creative is about to die. It's predicting a **40% drop** in performance next week. Most dashboards would tell you this *after* you lost the money. Oracle tells you *before*."

## 1:45 - Module 3: CURIOSITY (The Action)
*Action: Point to the third card (CURIOSITY)*

"Finally, **CURIOSITY**. This is the decision engine. It takes the Truth from Memory and the Predictions from Oracle to generate specific actions."

"It's not just giving us data; it's giving us a to-do list.
1.  **Scale Meta**: It's a winner with high efficiency.
2.  **Pause TikTok Creative**: Stop the bleeding before it happens.
3.  **Shift Budget**: Move $210/day to where it earns more."

"Total potential uplift? **$4,684 per day**."

## 2:15 - The Persona Toggle
*Action: Click "VP Growth (Jason)"*

"Now, watch this. I'm going to switch to **VP Growth**."

*Action: Dashboard updates*

"The data is the same, but the context changes. 'Attribution Truth' becomes 'Channel Performance'. The recommendations become more analytical. We're speaking the language of the user."

*Action: Click "Director (Emily)"*

"And for the **Director of Performance**? It's all about execution. 'TRUTH', 'ALERTS', 'ACTIONS'. Urgent, tactical, ready to push to Ad Manager."

## 2:45 - Conclusion
"This is Omnify.
**MEMORY** remembers the past.
**ORACLE** predicts the future.
**CURIOSITY** drives the action.
Thank you."
